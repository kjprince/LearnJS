      <p>Hey friend, my name is Ken Princeâ€”if you don't know much about me you should take a look at my bio.</p>
      <p>This is my programming blog where I write about learning Javascript. For me, learning JS is a means to an end.</p>
      <p>I'm not interested in getting a sweet job at Facebook, or working at that cool new startup Dispo. I just want to build shit.</p>
